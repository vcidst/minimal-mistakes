Administrators in Udaipur have decided to shut down cellular internet (and home broadband services too maybe) on this weekend from ~~9-5~~ 8AM-5PM in the day [[copy of order](http://shailendra.me/uploads/internetsuspensionorder-udaipur.pdf)]. This is not the first time this is happening. We are being normalized for what is an extreme action. This time the reason for shutdown is to deter cheating at a government examination. Shutdown internet for the whole district to stop cheating at an exam, makes perfect sense.

Folks at Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC) have been tracking the Internet Shutdowns across India for last four years. According to [InternetShutdowns.in](https://internetshutdowns.in/), state of Rajasthan has seen 25 shutdowns in this duration which is second highest for any state in India after J&K! SFLC's [handbook on Internet Shutdowns in India](https://sflc.in/sites/default/files/reports/Living%20in%20Digital%20Darkness%20-%20A%20Handbook%20on%20Internet%20Shutdowns%20in%20India%2c%20May%202018%20-%20by%20SFLCin.pdf) is fairly useful policy primer on the issue. 

This will mean a loss of livelihood to many (cab drivers, mobile recharge shops, food delivery businesses, remote employees, freelancers, the list goes on). This directly negates the whole idea of digital india and the push to digital payment that came after demonetization. This is probably harmful in hundred more ways.

It is even more important that you make yourself heard because there is no framework or metric right now that the Office of District Magistrate uses to decide what events/occasions duly require a blanket ban (if any at all!). By not speaking you are surrendering your rights to access to internet which is equivalent only to letting the government decide when you get to be online and when not.

I know a lot of people might suggest I should read a book or maybe go outside but however presumptuous and ignorant these unsolicited advises are, I stand for our right that access to basic services should not be left at the onus of any government.
