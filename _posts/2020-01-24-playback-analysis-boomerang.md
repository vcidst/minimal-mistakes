Boomerang video is a 1-second video clip that is turned into a GIF playing forward and reverse a couple of times. I was sitting with some friends last year at Rakkar, Himachal Pradesh and someone asked if the video is playing forward and backward linearly? We recorded a boomerang video of a stopwatch to see what happens.

Process,
1. Record a Boomerang Clip of a stopwatch
2. Break that clip into individual frames
3. Note down the timestamp in each frame

A graph of frame vs timestamp would also tell exactly how playback happens.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything different. Curved playbacks would have been a little too quirky for a tech giant.
